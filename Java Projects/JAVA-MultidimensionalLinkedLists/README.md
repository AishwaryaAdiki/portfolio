Objectives: 
•	Create and manipulate a multi-directional linked list in Java.  
•	Utilize inheritance and classes to create a basic data structure.


Problem: 
In preparation for the release of Disney’s Jungle Cruise movie next summer, 
you have been hired by the owner of a very small movie theater to develop the backend for an online ticket reservation system.
The program should display the current seating arrangement and allow the patron to select seats.  
To simplify, you may assume that there is one auditorium.
A report should be generated at the end of the program to specify for the auditorium:
how many seats were sold/unsold and how much money was earned.

A1base.txt, A2base.txt, and A3base.txt are all sample auditoriums/test cases
