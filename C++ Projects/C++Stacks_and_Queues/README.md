Project implementing c++ data structures such as stacks and queues to rearrange a in-fix expression to an post-fix expression. 

Problem Statement:
Gearbox Software in Frisco is working on a new physics engine to use with future games. 
As a recently hired intern, your job is to build a calculator to use in the engine. 
The calculator must be able to handle multiple operations and preserve the order of operations. 
To evaluate the expressions, you must convert the expression from infix to postfix notation and then evaluate. 
Both the conversion and the evaluation require the use of a stack.

Detailed Project descriptions can be found in Project4(3).pdf. See Project Pseudocode for further reference.

Stack.hpp and Stack.cpp consist of the class and function definitions respectively.
Node.hpp and Node.cpp consist of the Node Class (for storing operators and Operands) and function definitions respectively.

Values.txt is a sample test case
